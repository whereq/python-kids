Hi team, welcome to participate in the projects! Here we have another place for communication, especially for developers not from YRDSB. There are only two guidelines to follow here:

1. Please discuss programming learning-related topics only.
2. When sharing your input, add your name at the beginning in the format
   ```
     [YOUR_NAME]: YOUR message.
   ```
   It's better to keep your messages in one line and add an empty line above your message to separate it from others' input.

[Aria]: Henlo sorry, Hello!!!!  Is it just me or does leo(the Constellation) look like a clothes hanger? 

[Maggie]: It,s not a cloths hanger, that was just a trial test, we still have to perfect it. Also, I will be gone for a week since I have camp, maybe we could start our project August 12? Could we have a meeting time? We could have a zoom meeting to discuss, what time will be best for you?
