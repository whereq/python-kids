Tom's cat is grey, but Katia's fox is grey to, so they had a mix-up and Katia got Tom's grey cat and Tom got Katia's fox.
Katia's P.O.V
Saying goodbye to Tom, I clipped the leash on my fox, Lulu, before skipping down the cobblestone road all the way home. Once there, my mom's warm voice called, 
"Kat, you back?" 
"Yes," I replid. Dad's voice called, 
"Go to the kitchen, we have a surprise for you."
Clipping Lulu's leash to the doorknob,  I undid her collar. Normaly, Lulu would go lie on the sofa, so I frownded when Lulu simply curlled into a ball and 
started snoring, but I shrugged it of. 'she must be tired,' I thought, before going to the kitchen.
