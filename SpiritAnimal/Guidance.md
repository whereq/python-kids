1. How to create an interactive application for presenting the quiz and collecting answers.

2. Implementing validation for checking if the answers match the expected format (e.g., yes/no or multiple-choice options, no free-text input).

3. How to handle input failure tolerance and provide appropriate feedback to users.

4. Creating logic to direct users to different paths based on their answers.

5. Organizing the quiz logic within the code and splitting it into multiple functions/methods based on categories, types, tags, etc.

6. Consider using a separate resource file to store the quiz logic or answers (e.g., json/yaml/xml/plain text).

7. Understanding the differences between various file types (plain text/binary) and formats (json/yaml/xml/self-defined structure).

8. Evaluating the pros and cons of different file formats and selecting the most suitable format for this project and explaining the reasons behind the choice.
   
9. Exploring the possibility of converting the application into a GUI-based interface.
